    <h1>January 28</h1>
    <h2>The first date</h2>
    <div id="div1">  
       <p class="one"> First of all I want to say thank you, thank you, thank you to Rhonda Byrne and The Secret.Two months ago I wasn’t in a great place.I had had a very stressful six months and I instigated a split with my partner of seven years.</p>
       <p> I felt everything was wrong in our relationship and I treated him badly. I realised after a week that I had made a mistake but he wouldn’t even try and listen to me or sort things out. We had little or no communication and no reason to see one another as we live a distance apart. I was devastated and couldn’t see a way forward. I told everyone it was over for good and was in a very negative head space.</p>
       <p> A few years ago I had downloaded The Secret and started reading it again. I changed my whole negative mindset to appreciating and being grateful for everything I had. I was reading the part about relationships and decided that I would write down for 30 days, everything about my ex that I appreciated.</p>

    <h1>November 19</h1>
    <h2>the wedding bells</h2>
    <div>
       <p class="one">I appreciated his humor and how he could make me laugh. I appreciated when we would sit and talk and really listen, the list went on.</p>
       <p>After a week we were back texting one another. Then he called and we talked so much and so honestly about everything. We have been communicating so much over the last three weeks and everything I wrote down in my journal that I appreciated about him, I am receiving it in abundance. We have been spending time together which is magical. We are going on a date next week and I am so grateful for this second chance.</p>
       <p>If you want to improve your relationship, follow The Secret, push any negative thoughts away and be grateful for everything around you and for everything you have. Believe in yourself and you will receive everything your heart desires.</p>
